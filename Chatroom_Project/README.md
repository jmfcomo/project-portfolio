# Chatroom Project

### Project Overview

This is a project that I made for a Computer Networks class during the Spring 2023 semester.  It consists of two Python programs, a server, and a client.  The server program can connect to many instances of the client program, to sends messages to everyone connect, or to send message to individual users.  There is also a user database that allows new users to be created, and existing user accounts to be accessed.  

### Project Examples

The project files are contained in this folder, with instructions on how to run each the client and server.
