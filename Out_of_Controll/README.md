# Out of ContROLL

### Project Overview

Out of Controll was a game that I made for TigerHacks 2022, along with Jasper Holland, Lauren Bissey, and Sam Hirner.  This game was made over a 36 hour period largely using Unity.  It is a game about racing around in office chairs, attempting to beat an AI player through a series of office cubicle themed courses.  The game won Best Game and Crowd Favorite at the event.
