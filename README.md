# project-portfolio

 Hello!  This is a selection of a few projects that I have made over the last year or so of work as a computer science student.  A brief description of each project will be given here, with more detailed descriptions as well as any code and other resources being found in each project's folder.

 ## Project Descriptions

Chatroom Project:
This project is composed of a server and client written in Python which communicate with each other to enable a multi-user chatroom with account as well as direct message features.

Creating Modular and Versatile Robotics Systems:
This project, largely using ROS and Docker is an exploration of my research into looking at improving the processes for robotics research.  It includes a paper on the topic.

Out of ContROLL:
This is a game that I made, along with a team, for a gamejam which features the player racing against an AI in an office chair, through a variety of office-themed levels.

Shamrock Website:
This is a website, using a MySQL, Node, Express, React, and SASS stack.  The website is a prototype for The Shamrock, a student-run magazine.
