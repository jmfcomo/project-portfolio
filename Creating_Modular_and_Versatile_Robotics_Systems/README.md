# Creating Modular and Versatile Robotics Systems

### Project Overview

This is a project that I worked on from the spring of 2022 through the spring of 2023.  This was done through research with the High-Performance Data-Intensive Computing Lab under Dr. Grant Scott. More can be learned about this lab [here](https://scottgs.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/).  Throughout this research, I worked in many different veins, primarily related to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). I also made use of many other technologies such as Docker, OpenCV, and Nvidia CUDA.  I used these technologies to explore ways to create tools for robotics research that enable modular design. The combination of ROS with Docker allows for robotics projects to be split into individual nodes which can be modified and grouped together into larger projects, and run with a single command through Docker Compose.  

### Project Examples

While I am not able to show much of the actual code of this project, during the spring 2023 semester I wrote a capstone paper summarizing my work, which can be seen in this folder.
